# iShop
Hello everyone, I would like to show you my WPF application project. It's not finished yet, and I will be adding changes systematically. The application is called iShop (not very original, but it's something). iShop is a simple device designed to help with store management. From within the application, you will be able to add, delete, and browse products. It also allows you to manage customer names, addresses for delivery purposes. The application connects to a local SQL database where all the data will be stored.

# Home Page
Here is the preliminary homepage design. It features a simple UI with the application's functionalities.

The project is being and will be assembled entirely by me. I will be providing a list of added and implemented functions.
